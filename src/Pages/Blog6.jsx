              The legality of cryptocurrency mining varies widely across
              different countries and jurisdictions. While some countries have
              embraced the technology and its potential, others have imposed
              restrictions or outright bans.

                Key Factors Influencing Legality:
              </h2>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Regulatory Framework:</strong> Countries with clear
                  regulations governing cryptocurrency exchanges and trading
                  often have a more permissive stance towards mining.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Tax Laws:</strong> Tax implications for mining income
                  can vary significantly. Some countries treat it as regular
                  income, while others have specific tax treatments for digital
                  assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Energy Consumption:</strong> The high energy
                  consumption of mining operations has led to concerns about
                  their environmental impact. Countries with strict
                  environmental regulations may impose restrictions or
                  additional fees.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Economic Considerations:</strong> Some countries may
                  view mining as a potential source of economic growth and
                  innovation. Mining can generate foreign exchange earnings,
                  particularly in countries with abundant energy resources.
